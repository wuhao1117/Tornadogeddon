<Angel>
Well Spirit, now that you've warmed up$It is time to properly begin our task.

<Angel>
Destroy as much as you can, you will gain reputation by doing so.

<Angel>
The archangels have also scattered some$holy beacons across the land.

<Angel>
They are to be used to clean up the debris$that all this destruction is creating.$Pick them up and drop them off at designated holy zones.

<Angel>
They will then activate and signal the archangels$to smite that area with holy power.$Helping them will greatly increase your reputation.

<Death>
What a waste.

<Angel>
Excuse me?

<Death>
All that filth is perfect for my new Limbo.$It would make for a very disparaging atmosphere.

<Death>
Brings a tear to my eye...

<Death>
Spirit, how about you help me decorate Limbo.$My reapers have dropped statues for you to move.$Plant them at those zones instead.

<Angel>
Sacrilage!$Spirit, don't be fooled!

<Death>
Exactly, be strengthened instead. I can grant you power.$Power will get you respect.$Although personally, fear is a more efficient catalyst...

<Death>
You know how to pick up objects don't you?$It should be easy for you...

<Angel>
Q should do the trick!$To pick up and to throw!$Make sure it lands inside the dropoff zone.

<Death>
Q?? What are you babbling about?

<Death>
Regardless, remember to cause enough destruction.$Otherwise, I'm sure even the Angel would agree$that you would be wasting both of our time.

<Death>
Also, make good use of the river,$it may speed things up a bit.
