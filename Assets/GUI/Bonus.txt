<Death>
How did we end up here?

<Angel>
I don't know, I did not transport us.$And I definitely would not have taken you.

<?????>
GREETINGS.

<Angel>
!!!

<Death>
Interesting, so he has awakened.

<Death>
The Creator is certainly pulling out all the stops.$I did not expect the help of this old one to be called upon.

<Angel>
Who or what is he?

<Death>
Cthulhu.

<Cthulhu>
THIS IS MY TESTING AREA, YOUR SPIRIT SHALL HELP ME.

<Cthulhu>
THAT SIGN SHALL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.$YOU WILL NOW READ IT.

<Death>
I would do as he says.$Angering him would not be wise.$Unless you both are tired of living.

<Angel>
Even you fear him?

<Death>
Hardly, he is no match for me.

<Angel>
Well Spirit, it seems we better listen.$The sign is over there.$Let's move closer and see what it says.
