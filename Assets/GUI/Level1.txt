<Angel>
Greetings spirit!$I am a messenger of the Creator.$You may simply call me Angel for now.
<Angel>
As you may have noticed, the apocalypse is commencing.$Destroy as many non-natural objects as you can so that$we may reset this world. 

<Angel>
Since you have just awakened,$it is understandable if you wish to build your stamina.$Let's start with this area over here, do your best! 

<Angel>
I've also created a rendezvous location.$Meet me there when you have finished your task.$It will be bathed in a soothing green light.

<Death>
My, my... Aren't we having fun? It seems I'm late to this party.

<Angel>
Death! What are you doing here?

	
<Death>
Why so hostile?$I'm just doing my job, keeping track of the dead.

<Death>
Unfortunately, this extinction event requires$far more space than Limbo can hold.

<Angel>
I thought Limbo was infinite.

<Death>
Hah! You foolish little angel; space is quickly running out$and I require more room.

<Death>
As such, I think I'll extend Limbo into this world for a bit,$at least until this apocalypse nonsense is over with.$Honestly, just when I was about to go on vacation.

	
<Angel>
I will not stand here and let you do this!

	
<Death>
Then stand somewhere else.

<Death>
You have not the authority nor power to tell me what to do.$Besides, the Creator doesn't care, you were there for the speech.$This is only temporary... I think.
	
<Angel>
...Fine, but this tornado works for me.

<Death>
Is that so?$Tornado, do my bidding and I will make you even stronger.

<Death>
I suppose you can still use that disturbing$meeting point to report to me as well.
