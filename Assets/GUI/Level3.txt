<Angel>
... And so Spirit, that is how I became the$youngest angel to take part in this cleansing.

<Death>
... ... ...

<Angel>
Are you actually asleep?$Incredible!

<Death>
...Hmm? What? Tracking all these souls is quite tiring.$And lately I've been hearing this droning sound...
<Angel>
I hear nothing, there is only me.

<Death>
Oh good, so you've noticed.

<Death>
In any case, Spirit, it looks like you're on$clean up duty this time.

<Death>
It appears that a lightning spirit has recently$passed through this area.

<Death>
Quite a shoddy job though.$It must be under the direction of another angel...

<Angel>
Those spirits' duty is to assist the main force.$Not to cause the greatest amount of destruction.

<Angel>
Use the fire and the lingering$lightning clouds to empower yourself.

<Angel>
That underworlder has no concept of teamwork.$Nor does he understand the importance of our mission.

<Angel>
The Creator has grand designs for this world.$We are to work together if our$plan should come into fruition!

<Angel>
And then we must...

<Death>
... ... ...

<Angel>
Accidentally fell asleep again?

<Death>
... No, I assure you, that was strictly intentional.
